				<summary>What the Fonts?</summary>
				<p>There are a variety of wonderful fonts availible by default in most programs. 
				   However, on occasion one might wish to draw or create their own fonts. Infact, 
				   the creation of fonts is a world it's own, and our vast standard collection is 
				   only a starter's kit. There are an infinite nuber of fonts for technical use, 
				   asthetic properties, and the great magic of the avant garde.
