                <h2>The History Of Racoons</h2>
                <p class="history">
                     The most distinguishing features of raccoons are their black eye masks, bushy ringed tails,
                    and pointed black ears with white trim (Fox 2000).  The raccoon’s coat has a rather grizzled 
                    appearance with dark colored hair ranging from a dark gray and black color above with buff or 
                    rust colors interspersed.  To help with concealment the raccoon has a light buff colored
                    underside, and when viewed on a tree branch from below their light color blends in with the 
                    light sky; when viewed from above their dark color blends into the dark forest floor.  
                    The variations in raccoon coat coloration mostly depend on geographic location, where the 
                    darkest coat colors are in the most humid climates, the lighter colored coats in the dryer,
                    desert climates, and in the southeast coastal regions the coats have a lighter, reddish color.  
                    The raccoon’s bushy tail with black brown tip has between 5 and 7 dark rings including the tip.
                    The tail is used for fat storage during the fall, for balance while climbing, 
                    and as a brace when sitting on its haunches (MacClintock 1981; Goldman 1950).

                    <p class="poem">
                        I dream that tonight I am a raccoon
                        And it is here in this body that I store the notion <br>
                        That my sadness will last forever,<br>
                        In the treasury of unclaimed awareness,<br>
                        Where pits of the peaches could never re-sprout...<br>
                        I dig deep into the indent of a Denver ravine,<br>
                        Gnaw knee-high into the hollow ridges of hominids and their homelands,<br>
                        Belly-wade in bottomless mud waters west of wherever they don’t go, though<br>
                        Lurid in my languor now, I laminate my slick turf onto Continental limestone slabs<br>
                        And, then, all-at-once, at noon, just like that,<br>
                        I call it a day.<br>
                        A tired little raccoon<br>
                        Can’t bear without a rest <br>
                        Through the midday...<br>
                        I arise as the coon falls under.<br>
                        Reclaiming Human Sorrow, my Wrong-Headed Brother,<br>
                        Waxing thunderously, now, in the mind’s cluttered cage<br>
                        In this day of coffee and chit-chat and left-turns,<br>
                        I’ll dream tonight I am a raccoon.<br>
                        So that we may both get out and roam.<br>
